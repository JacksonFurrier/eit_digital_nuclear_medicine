abstract = {Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) is crucial for evaluating myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) and assessing LV functions. In this study, a novel method combining deep learning with shape priors was developed and validated to extract the LV myocardium and automatically measure LV functional parameters. The method integrates a three-dimensional (3D) V-Net with a shape deformation module that incorporates shape priors generated by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to guide its output during training. A retrospective analysis was performed on an MPS dataset comprising 31 subjects without or with mild ischemia, 32 subjects with moderate ischemia, and 12 subjects with severe ischemia. Myocardial contours were manually annotated as the ground truth. A 5-fold stratified cross-validation was used to train and validate the models. The clinical performance was evaluated by measuring LV end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and scar burden from the extracted myocardial contours. There were excellent agreements between segmentation results by our proposed model and those from the ground truth, with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.9573 ± 0.0244, 0.9821 ± 0.0137, and 0.9903 ± 0.0041, as well as Hausdorff distances (HD) of 6.7529 ± 2.7334 mm, 7.2507 ± 3.1952 mm, and 7.6121 ± 3.0134 mm in extracting the LV endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between LVEF, ESV, EDV, stress scar burden, and rest scar burden measured from our model results and the ground truth were 0.92, 0.958, 0.952, 0.972, and 0.958, respectively. The proposed method achieved a high accuracy in extracting LV myocardial contours and assessing LV functions.}

abstract = {Purpose : The authors develop the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for multimodality imaging research. Methods: Highly detailed whole-body anatomies for the adult male and female were defined in the XCAT using nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and subdivision surfaces based on segmentation of the Visible Male and Female anatomical datasets from the National Library of Medicine as well as patient datasets. Using the flexibility of these surfaces, the Visible Human anatomies were transformed to match body measurements and organ volumes for a 50th percentile (height and weight) male and female. The desired body measurements for the models were obtained using thePEOPLESIZE program that contains anthropometric dimensions categorized from 1st to the 99th percentile for US adults. The desired organ volumes were determined from ICRP Publication 89 [ICRP, “Basic anatomical and physiological data for use in radiological protection: reference values,” ICRP Publication 89 (International Commission on Radiological Protection, New York, NY, 2002)]. The male and female anatomies serve as standard templates upon which anatomical variations may be modeled in the XCAT through user-defined parameters. Parametrized models for the cardiac and respiratory motions were also incorporated into the XCAT based on high-resolution cardiac- and respiratory-gated multislice CT data. To demonstrate the usefulness of the phantom, the authors show example simulation studies in PET, SPECT, and CT using publicly available simulation packages. Results: As demonstrated in the pilot studies, the 4D XCAT (which includes thousands of anatomical structures) can produce realistic imaging data when combined with accurate models of the imaging process. With the flexibility of the NURBS surface primitives, any number of different anatomies, cardiac or respiratory motions or patterns, and spatial resolutions can be simulated to perform imaging research. Conclusions: With the ability to produce realistic, predictive 3D and 4D imaging data from populations of normal and abnormal patients under various imaging parameters, the authors conclude that the XCAT provides an important tool in imaging research to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques. In the field of x-ray CT, the phantom may also provide the necessary foundation with which to optimize clinical CT applications in terms of image quality versus radiation dose, an area of research that is becoming more significant with the growing use of CT.},

abstract = {Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) is the golden standard in detecting and assessing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Due to its role and incidence in diagnostics, automated and semi-automated solutions are available aiding diagnoses based on the perfusion and function of the left ventricle. Evaluation with Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) cameras often takes > 30 minutes and due to patient cardinality, shortened acquisition produces images with lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), challenging automated solutions. Here a fully automated method is presented, solving the left ventricle (LV) segmentation problem. The method is a 3D U-Net-based, self-supervised learning (SSL) approach, with a rich augmentation pipeline. A brief study is presented where the proposed algorithm is compared to the current state-of-the-art solution in Machine Learning (ML), with the evaluation of various segmentation metrics of the left ventricular muscle tissue. The proposed method showed an effective 89 \% precision on the segmentation task of MPI studies on both simulated and real datasets. In conclusion, the technique can aid the evaluation of MPI studies in clinical environments by automating the segmentation of studies with a high success rate.},
